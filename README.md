# Flipkart-Product-Lisitng-Page
this is a product listing page made using html.
I've used various heading tags, anchor tag, img tag, pararaph tag, inline and block tags, meta tags and span tag.
things i've learnt- 
we need to optimize website for all screen sizes, 
using only one h1 tag in one page is a good practice.
the hierachical order of heading tags should be maintained.
span is used to bind inline elements.
